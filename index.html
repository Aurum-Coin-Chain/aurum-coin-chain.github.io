  <p><strong>1. Total Supply: 21 million AU</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 million AU permanently locked for Satoshi Nakamoto (comparable to lost BTC)</li>
    <li>20 million AU actively circulating or allocated for distribution</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>2. Halving Distribution (1.3 million AU)</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Daily reward: 450 AU</li>
    <li>Halving every 4 years (similar to Bitcoin's halving)</li>
    <li>Coins are sold during the Ethereum phase (as Halving-Coins)</li>
    <li>Proceeds are fully added to WBTC trading liquidity</li>
    <li>No additional coins will be sold afterwards – only available through staking</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>3. Presale & Initial Allocation</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>AU tokens are publicly sold during the Ethereum phase</li>
    <li>Payment in USDC (Ethereum only)</li>
    <li>Most proceeds are converted into real BTC and locked into the reserve</li>
    <li>The remaining funds support project development and initial WBTC trading liquidity</li>
    <li>No team allocation, no insider discounts – everyone buys under equal conditions</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>4. Redemption (only on the AURUM chain)</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>AU → BTC (via aBTC) with a 21% penalty</li>
    <li>The 21% remains permanently in the BTC reserve</li>
    <li>Redeemed AU is fully burned</li>
    <li>Protects the system from abuse and encourages long-term holding</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>5. Symbolic Burn on Transactions</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>A small amount of AU is automatically burned with every Ethereum transaction</li>
    <li>Honors Bitcoin scarcity and reinforces AUs deflationary nature</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>6. Bitcoin Reserve</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Backed by real BTC, publicly visible in a multisig wallet</li>
    <li>Permanently secured – never withdrawable</li>
    <li>Grows through presale proceeds, redemption penalties, and merchandise revenue</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>7. Merchandise & Special Actions</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>High-quality products can be purchased with BTC, fiat, or AU during limited events</li>
    <li>AU used in such actions is burned</li>
    <li>Profits (after costs) are voluntarily added to the BTC reserve</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>8. No Promises – But a Real Floor</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>AURUM is not a financial product and makes no return guarantees</li>

      <h2><img src="favicon-64-transparent.png" class="mini-icon" />Whitepaper</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>PoV – Proof of Value Protocol</strong></li>
    <li><strong>1. Introduction</strong><br>
      AURUM (AU) starts as a meme coin but follows a serious, long-term vision: a deflationary token system backed by real Bitcoin. The foundation is formed by publicly visible BTC reserves that remain permanently in the system. AURUM combines the charm of a community token with true value coverage.
    </li>
    <li><strong>2. No Central Company – 100% Decentralization</strong><br>
      There is no central company or authority behind AURUM. The project is fully decentralized. Merchandise is voluntarily offered by supporters and has no legal or financial connection to the token. All BTC revenue (after costs) is voluntarily added to the reserve. The team receives no free AU – all tokens are purchased under the same conditions as the community.
    </li>
    <li><strong>3. AURUMBTC (aBTC)</strong><br>
      Unlike centralized solutions like WBTC, which can be frozen or censored, AURUM's own wrapped Bitcoin (aBTC) will only exist on the AURUM blockchain: censorship-resistant, fully decentralized, secured by BTC in a 3/5 multisig wallet.<br>
      The protocol defines the swap mechanism: Anyone exchanging AU for aBTC receives only 79% in BTC. The remaining 21% permanently stays in the reserve. The exchanged AU is fully burned.<br>
      This process is irreversible – it reduces AU supply and aBTC pool simultaneously, adding a deflationary effect.
    </li>
    <li><strong>4. Bitcoin Reserve & Irreversibility</strong><br>
      Once BTC enters the AURUM reserve, it permanently exits market circulation. No withdrawals, no reclaiming. The reserve remains in the system forever – creating a reliable, transparent, and immutable value base for AU.
    </li>
    <li><strong>5. Redemption with Deflationary Logic</strong><br>
      Redemption is allowed – but fixed: only 79% of BTC value is returned, 21% remains in the reserve. All returned AU is burned, reducing supply and strengthening system integrity.
    </li>
    <li><strong>6. Halving & Migration</strong><br>
      1.3 million AU (Halving-Coins) are sold on Ethereum in exchange for ETH or BTC. Proceeds are converted into WBTC and added to liquidity pools. These coins represent future "mining" rewards.<br>
      On the AURUM blockchain, coins will only be distributed through staking to node operators – daily, with halving cycles like Bitcoin.<br>
      Node operators secure the network and receive:
      <ul>
        <li>Halving-coins as reward</li>
        <li>Transaction fees</li>
      </ul>
      This provides long-term decentralized network security – based on staking, not mining.
    </li>
    <li><strong>7. Conclusion</strong><br>
      AURUM is more than a meme – it’s a deflationary BTC value system.<br>
      A place where Bitcoin stays – transparent, decentralized, final.
    </li>
    <li><strong>8. Why Bitcoin Must Stay in AURUM</strong><br>
      BTC is becoming scarcer – institutions accumulate while retail access becomes harder. AURUM reacts by collecting real BTC and locking it permanently in the system.<br>
      These BTC are non-sellable, non-withdrawable, and secured in a multisig wallet.<br>
      Anyone holding AU indirectly participates in this protected reserve.
    </li>
    <li><strong>9. Proof of Value (PoV)</strong><br>
      AURUM follows PoV – a new principle: value coverage instead of trust.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Each AU is backed by real BTC</li>
        <li>Halving-Coins only exist via WBTC swaps</li>
        <li>On-chain, Halving-Coins are distributed to nodes (no energy waste)</li>
      </ul>
      PoV maintains balance:
      <ul>
        <li>21% of AU-to-BTC swaps stay in reserve</li>
        <li>Burning of AU reduces supply</li>
        <li>Voluntary BTC donations grow reserve</li>
      </ul>
      AU only exists when value has been contributed – by BTC or network security.
    </li>
    <li><strong>10. Legal Disclaimer</strong><br>
      AURUM is not a financial product. It is a community-driven utility token, backed by a public BTC reserve.<br>
      Not a security, not an investment – no promises of profit or price.<br>
      BTC in the reserve only serves as transparent value coverage – not a guarantee or redemption claim.<br>
      AURUM is decentralized, open source, and not owned or controlled by any entity.<br>
      Started as a meme coin – but built for real value.
    </li>

    <section id="launchpad">
      <h2><img src="favicon-64-transparent.png" class="mini-icon" />Ethereum Launchpad</h2>
     <p>AURUM begins where today’s crypto world lives: on Ethereum. This first phase serves as a launchpad – for the token, the community, the idea.</p>
  <p>In a public presale, the AU token is sold. The goal is not quick profit, but long-term structure: most of the proceeds are converted into real Bitcoin and stored in a public, immutable reserve.</p>
  <p>AURUM deliberately starts as a meme coin – but with long-term vision.</p>
  <p>The reserve is visible live, but inaccessible to anyone. It is AURUM’s foundation – real, transparent, unmanipulable.</p>
  <p>While many companies claim to buy Bitcoin without showing their wallets, AURUM focuses on full transparency – showing the live BTC reserve. That’s Proof of Value.</p>
  <p>A portion of the funds goes to infrastructure, liquidity, and project development – the majority flows directly into the Bitcoin reserve.</p>
  <p>The team itself only participates in the presale – not before. No special allocations. No insiders. Everyone buys under the same conditions.</p>
  <p>Merchandise is also part of the launch phase: high-quality, limited products purchasable with Bitcoin, stablecoins, or AU. Profits after costs go into the BTC reserve voluntarily – not a promise, but visible reality.</p>
  <p>A strong symbol: one million AU coins are locked forever for Satoshi Nakamoto – publicly visible, permanently immobile. A digital tribute to the origin.</p>
  <p>This first phase on Ethereum is the setup. It is not the goal – but the road toward something permanent.</p>
</section>

    <section id="vision">
      <h2><img src="favicon-64-transparent.png" class="mini-icon" />Blockchain Vision</h2>
      <p>In Phase two, AURUM becomes independent.</p>
  <p>The dedicated blockchain launches – lightweight, accessible, and entirely built on real Bitcoin.</p>
  <p>No centralized platform, no interim solution – but a decentralized network sustaining itself.</p>
  <p>The AURUM blockchain is intentionally designed to be accessible:</p>
  <p>Anyone who holds AU can participate in the network with basic hardware.</p>
  <p>These nodes are lightweight, energy-efficient – and secure the decentralized system.</p>
  <p>This is AURUM’s core:</p>
  <p>We recall Bitcoin’s early days – when anyone could join with minimal resources.</p>
  <p>In AURUM, node operators take that role:</p>
  <p>They keep the network stable, validate transactions, and act like Bitcoin’s miners.</p>
  <p>For their contribution, they receive automated rewards:</p>
  <p>Regularly issued mining coins, halving every 4 years like Bitcoin, plus a share of transaction fees.</p>
  <p>Anyone holding AU can participate – no special hardware, no complexity – open and accessible to all.</p>
  <p>AURUM is open source. Anyone can view, understand, and improve the code.</p>
  <p>The community participates. New applications, interfaces, and expansions are welcome.</p>
  <p>No admin access. No central function. The code is the law.</p>
  <p>And the BTC reserve?</p>
  <p>It remains the anchor. It grows over time – public, visible, permanent.</p>
  <p>Every AU is backed by real BTC. While the reserve is fixed, the market price remains free.</p>
  <p>That means: There is always a real value floor – but no limit above.</p>
  <p>The market can value AU higher – but never below the reserve’s value.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Those wishing to exchange AU back into BTC can do so –</p>
  <p>but only via AURUM’s own wrapped Bitcoin (aBTC) with a 21% deduction.</p>
  <p>aBTC is AURUM’s internal form of Bitcoin, fully backed and circulating within the system.</p>
  <p>This protects the reserve and enables redemption – without destroying the foundation.</p>
  <p>Redeemed AU is burned – permanently. This reduces supply and protects the system.</p>
  <p>This deduction isn’t a barrier but a safeguard – preventing abuse by large actors.</p>
  <p>Greed becomes unattractive. The reserve stays intact. The community remains stable.</p>
  <hr />
  <h3>🟡 AURUM – The Vision: Secure Bitcoin before it’s too late</h3>
  <p>Bitcoin is becoming scarce. Major exchanges, funds, and institutions are buying all they can.</p>
  <p>Access to BTC is growing more difficult and expensive for everyday users.</p>
  <p>AURUM responds by collecting real BTC – while it's still accessible – and locking it into the system forever.</p>
  <p>These BTC are not for sale. No one can retrieve them. They remain secured inside AURUM permanently.</p>
  <p>aBTC is the only internal access – fully backed and used only within the system.</p>
  <p>And that’s what gives AU its value.</p>
  <p>Because AU isn’t just a token. AU is a share of a system that permanently holds real BTC – publicly, securely, and censorship-resistant.</p>
  <p>Whoever understands this now stands where Bitcoiners stood in 2009: right at the beginning.</p>
  <p>The more BTC flows into the reserve, the higher the minimum value rises.</p>
  <p>And the market price? That remains free. But the floor stays – and it grows.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>AURUM is a digital vault. Open to all. Untouchable by others.</p>
  <p>What’s being created here is more than a project. It’s a new foundation –</p>
  <p>a new way to store value – not through computation, but through participation, trust, and transparency.</p>
  <hr />
  <h3>🟡 AURUM is secured by Bitcoin.</h3>
  <p>🔓 It has a floor – but no top.</p>
